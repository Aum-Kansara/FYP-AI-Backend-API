0,WomQr-jRO1c,,"This week freeCodeCamp founder Quincy Larson interviews Phoebe Voong-Fadel about her childhood as the daughter of refugees, and how she self-studied coding and became a professional developer. 

Phoebe worked from age 12 at her parent's Chinese take-out restaurant. She was able to study history at the London School of Economics, before working in higher ed. She left her job to raise two kids due to the high cost of childcare in the UK, and spent years self-studying coding before becoming a software developer at age 36.

I recorded this podcast live and I haven't edited it at all. I want to capture the feel of a real live conversation, with all the human quirks that entails. As with all my podcast episodes, I start by performing a classic bass line. Can you guess what song this bass line is from? It's from 1989.

Phoebe has earned multiple certifications from freeCodeCamp, and also published a number of articles on our publication.

How Phoebe went from stay-at-home mom to Front End Web Developer at age 36: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-i-went-from-stay-at-home-mum-to-front-end-web-developer-39724046692a/

Type predicates are an interesting feature in TypeScript since they cover a very niche use case that can cause type errors if you are not aware of this solution.

The TypeScript documentation is definitely not as good as it could be, but one thing that blows my mind is their recommendation of using interfaces over types. Types are more powerful in nearly every way which is why I love them and in this video I explain all the differences between types and interfaces and why you should probably be using types.

4.3 Inch LCD Touchscreen on Amazon - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09B29T8YF?tag=elietherton-20

This 800x480 touchscreen for the Raspberry Pi works surprisingly well.  It allows for the full Pi OS GUI, is detailed enough to allow you to read code in VSCode and plays YouTube videos well.

This is a great add-on for Network  Appliances and IoT devices so that you can easily see important information without having to figure out the devices DHCP Address.

It works off of a basic USB Battery, but may give ""low voltage"" warnings.

NOTE: I purchased this with my own money and have no link to the company.  I found this while building my IoT Messaging Projects using the Blues IoT Modem.",,11.0,95.0,2143,Science & Technology

This project has you create a portable tracking device that sends its location to a web server over the cell network.  The locations are stored on the server in a SQLite database.

Users can then access a web app that shows the last 5 locations of the device in embedded Google Maps.

Code for this project - https://github.com/elithecomputerguy/AI-Powered-Decision-Tree-for-Talking-Computer-Python-OpenAI-API-Google-Speech-/tree/main

This project uses SQLite as a cacheing mechanism for OpenAI API requests.  When a user makes a request from OpenAI the request and the response is inserted into a SQLite table.  The script checks the if a request is already stored in the database and if it is then the database is read from instead of doing an API call.

Code and Notes -- https://github.com/elithecomputerguy/AI-Powered-Decision-Tree-for-Talking-Computer-Python-OpenAI-API-Google-Speech-

In this class we create an OpenAI powered decision tree so that users can communicate with our computer/ robot using their own language and linguistic style.  You send your entire file of functions to OpenAI, and then request the function that most appropriately corresponds to what the user is asking for.

This means you no longer have to hard code specific trigger words for events.",,15.0,95.0,2707,Science & Technology

Our Louis Rossmann Face Tracking Robot is ALIVE!!!!

This project uses a Geekom AS6 Mini PC, an Arduino, OpenCV and Python to create an autonomous robot that follows someone's face.

OpenCV finds the X Axis coordinates of the face and then sends a serial command to the Arduino Subsystem to move the wheels left or right.

For distance we use OpenCV to find the width of the face and use that as an analogue for range with the vehicle moving forward or back based on the Width of the face object.

It can cut through basically anything including paper, wood, leather, and multiple types of metal and acrylic . It can etch everything including metal and glass. 

I'm going to show over 12 projects I made using the xTool D1 Pro 20w and some of its accessories. I use the new Rotary Tool, Honeycomb Working Panel, air assist and some of xTool's engraving accessories. I can't believe I was able to make all of these cool things with zero experience.

The xTool D1 Pro 20w Cutting and Engraving Machine is an industrial machine downsized for designers and hobbyists. All of the internal moving components are industrialized steel, but it is light enough to easy carry. The laser is accurate to .08 mm and moves with a precision of .01 mm. It has height adjustment, engraves and cuts numerous materials and is easy to adjust.

I'd greatly appreciate a review for it if you have time.

I provide here in this PostgreSQL tutorial a full course you can use to master PostgreSQL. Postgres is an object relational database that is just as fast as MySQL that adheres more closely to SQL standards and excels at concurrency. Postgres is also superior at avoiding data corruption. 

Postgres also provides more advanced data types and allows for the creation of custom types, operators and index types. 

Postgres is normally the best option when extensibility, scalability and data integrity are most important to you. The table of contents below provides timestamps to everything I cover.

I'd greatly appreciate a review for it if you have time.

I created this Golang tutorial to be the definitive course. I provide in this full course more information than you can get in any book. The table of contents follows below. Both the core language and numerous projects are provided to help you master Go. Also there is only one 5 second ad, so nothing will get in the way of your learning process!

Go is one of the fastest growing languages and for good reason. Go makes it very easy to write fast code without having to tweak with the code. The code is understandable, efficient, excels at concurrency, provides great backend support for web apps, handles errors much like Rust and manages memory efficiently.

✳️ Learned Numerous Scales
✳️ Play with Pick or Fingers
✳️ Learned Numerous Strumming Patterns
✳️ 12 Bar Blues
✳️ Percussion Techniques
✳️ Can Play Most Intermediate Songs with Practice

It can cut through basically anything. Because it is a laser though it can't cut through clear materials. It can etch everything including metal and glass. 

I'm going to show a bunch of projects I made using the xTool D1 and some of its accessories. I use the new Rotary Tool, Honeycomb Working Panel and some of Makeblock's engraving accessories. I can't believe I was able to make all of these cool things with zero experience.

The Makeblock xTool D1 Cutting and Engraving Machine is an industrial machine downsized for designers and hobbyists. All of the internal moving components are industrialized steel, but it is light enough to easy carry. The laser is accurate to .08 mm and moves with a precision of .01 mm. It has height adjustment, engraves and cuts numerous materials and is easy to adjust.

93,Uym4-KhP3Lc,algorithms data structure and algorithms graph algorithm sorting algorithm searching algorithm bfs dfs breadth first search depth first search dijkstra's algorithm a* a* algorithm linear search binary search bubble sort insertion sort merge sort,"It's my thought that every programmer should know these 3 types of algorithms. We actually go over 9 algorithms, what they are, how they work, real-world use cases, complete with code examples and explanations, but they fall under 3 categories, 3 types of algorithms you should know. 

Sorting Algorithms - used to rearrange elements in a list or an array in a certain order. We discuss bubble sort, insertion sort, and merge sort.

Searching Algorithms - used to find or retrieve an element from a data structure, or to determine its existence and location in the dataset. We discuss linear search and binary search.

Graph Algorithms - used to solve problems related to graph theory, where data is represented as a collection of nodes (or vertices) connected by edges. You probably know these as trees. We discuss depth-first search (dfs), breadth-first search (bfs), Dijkstra's algorithm, and A* algorithm.

So, why are these algorithms you should you know? Because they form the foundation of efficient problem-solving in computer science. Their study not only enhances programming skills but also deepens analytical thinking. And they’re instrumental in optimizing software performance across a wide range of real-world applications. I hope you enjoy the video and learn a thing or two!

How much do software engineers actually make? There are many variables that dictate this: experience level, company at which you work (including their industry), location, and the specific programming technologies and languages you use - as well as your ability to negotiate yourself a higher salary.

Well in today's video, not only are we going to look at the visuals for the median salary based on those individual variables, but also the top salaries in each level of experience (so entry-level software engineer, mid-level software engineer, senior software engineer, staff software engineer, and principal software engineer), what companies are paying those top salaries, and the breakdown of base salary, stock, and bonus - all beautifully visualized.

There's a better way to write code, and that's by having your code meet 3 high-level goals. As a programmer, every time you write code you want to be asking yourself if this code meets those 3 goals. And in doing so, it’ll have you build a coder’s mindset so every time you pick up a coding task, you’re thinking like a programmer without even thinking about it.

96,c6vjFQBlxvY,VIM vim history vi text editor ide bram moolenaar the making of vim the history of vim vi improved,"Vim is the most beloved (and hated) text editor the world has ever seen. The development of Vim is one that every tech enthusiast should know.

From a personal challenge in 1988 to one of the most beloved text editors in the world, the evolution and development of Vim is a compelling tale of individual ingenuity coming together, community-driven enhancement, and open-source principles.
Vim, for those unfamiliar, is a text editor, known for its efficiency, customizability, and powerful command-based interface. But it's more than just a text editor; it's an ecosystem of customization, efficiency, and a unique approach to coding that has captivated programmers around the world.
One could say it all started in 1988, with Bram Moolenaar, a Dutch software developer, after getting the new Amiga computer. All he wanted to do was edit code in vi, or in his case Stevie, a clone of Vi, but it was buggy and frankly, unsatisfying. So Bram began writing a new vi port of sorts, a project he named “Vi IMitation”, or “Vim” for short. This is the story of the development of the Vim text editor, and a tribute to its late creator, maintainer, and benevolent dictator for life of Vim, Bram Moolenaar.

I hope you enjoyed it. Making these videos about computer science history has become a passion of mine, with this being the 4th episode in the series and many more to come.

Initially called Berkeley Unix, as it was based on the source code of the original Unix developed at Bell Labs, BSD, or Berkeley Software Distribution, is a now discontinued operating system developed and distributed by the Computer Systems Research Group at the University of California, Berkeley by a team led by Bill Joy in the 1970s.

🖥️ Dev Notes Newsletter: https://www.devnotesdaily.com/

And to understand BSD, you must understand these early days of Unix. In that, although it was proprietary, the earliest distributions of Unix included the source code, allowing researchers at universities to modify and extend Unix. The operating system arrived at Berkeley in 1974, at the request of computer science professor Bob Fabry, a Symposium on Operating Systems Principles committee member, where Unix was first presented. BSD came to life as a variant of Unix in the late 1970s by a team of programmers at UC Berkeley.
At first, BSD was not a clone of Unix, or even a substantially different version of it. It just included some extra features, which were intertwined with code owned by AT&T...

Last year I built an AI that shoots me in the face with a nerf gun when I get distracted, but it’s not working. I’m still finding myself getting distracted, so I figured I’d take a slightly different approach. Instead of punishing me for getting distracted, how about I redirect that towards the distractions themselves.
I'll redirect the nerf gun to target the door as a deterrent against distractions. As software engineers, we must innovate. Consider this: each sip of your morning coffee takes about 4 seconds. That's 1oz per sip, 8oz per cup, and for developers, roughly 4 cups daily. This totals 128 seconds wasted daily just sipping coffee. Introducing the coffee dispenser: a water gun that delivers an ounce of coffee straight into my mouth every 5 minutes.
This system employs artificial intelligence in the form of real-time object detection and face tracking. Its nerf gun's camera identifies humans and uses real-time tracking for accuracy. The coffee dispenser's camera ensures the shot lands near my mouth by aiming directly at my face.

NVIDIA is definitely one of my favorite partners to work with, so if you're in the market for a laptop, I'd truly appreciate it if you used the link provided in the description!

My goal wasn’t to build a universal future proof API, even though that’s what I did. It was to build DatasetGPT, that operates just like ChatGPT, but scrapes the internet for the information you’re looking for and returns that as a dataset. The amount of data I’ve needed over the past month is astounding, from scraping YouTube videos for market research to scraping Amazon to get me data on competitive products to a company I’m hoping to buy. Now imagine one could just type “get me the 10 most popular YouTube videos from these three channels” into ChatGPT. Well that was DatasetGPT, and I made some progress on it too.
But as you'll find in the video, I need your help. Here’s how to get started: Fork or clone the repositories.
So for the GPT API, you’ll need to make an account and can utilize the free tokens. Change my credentials to your credentials.
For the Bright Data scraper, click this link https://brightdata.com/products/scraping-browser?utm_source=brand&utm_campaign=brnd-mkt_youtube_fknight&promo=fknight to make an account and utilize free spend limit. Go to dashboard, create a new proxy, name it want you want, and replace USERNAME:PASSWORD with yours - the host URL is the same. Ensure you have all of the dependencies installed using this command for the book-scraper: `npm install puppeteer-core` and this command for DatasetGPT: `npm install openai express cors body-parser`. If you need me to create a Wiki or README with this info, let me know.
Test each one out and they should work. Now you’re ready to combine the two to create my initial vision for DatasetGPT, which was really to act just like ChatGPT, but have the ability to access real-time data on the internet and scrape it via Bright Data’s Scrapping Browser and Puppeteer, then return it as a dataset in the requested format. That’s it.

The making of the GNU Project is a story that every tech enthusiast should know.

It all started in the early 1980s at the prestigious MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, where Richard Stallman, a passionate computer programmer and MIT alumnus, was working. Due to his increasing frustration of proprietary software, Richard Stallman announces the GNU Project on September 27, 1983 and resigns from the MIT AI Lab in 1984 to work on GNU full time. Stallman outlines all of the project’s objectives and philosophy in the now-famous GNU Manifesto.
In 1985, he founds the Free Software Foundation, or FSF, to support the GNU Project and promote the free software movement. The FSF becomes the project’s beating heart, providing legal and financial backing to help fund the development of free software. This was swiftly followed by the release of the powerful GNU Emacs text editor in 1985, the versatile GNU Compiler Collection, or GCC, in 1987, and the robust GNU Debugger, or GDB, in 1988.
As the project gains momentum, Stallman introduces the first version of the GNU General Public License, or GPL, in 1989. This ingenious legal framework protects the rights of free software users and developers, ensuring that GPL-licensed software remains free and open for all to modify and redistribute.
This brings us to 1991 - enter a young Finnish computer science student with a penchant for tinkering, Linus Torvalds. The Unix-like operating system, MINIX, couldn’t accomplish what Linus wanted it to do on his Intel 80386 CPU, which led him to create this little kernel, called Linux, in 1991 (more on that in this video - ""The Making of Linux..."" https://youtu.be/E0Q9KnYSVLc.
But he hadn’t created other software, like text editors, compilers, or debuggers - like GNU already had. But the kernel, that’s the one thing GNU was missing. Stallman saw Torvald’s kernel as the missing piece of the puzzle and set out to integrate it with the rest of the GNU operating system.
In 1992, Torvalds released the kernel under the GNU General Public License. Now that Linux was GPL-licensed, the Linux and GNU developers worked to combine the Linux kernel with the existing GNU components to create a fully functional and free operating system known as GNU/Linux.
We went over GNU/Linux in-depth in the first video in this series: “The Making of Linux: The World’s First Open Source Operating System”: https://youtu.be/E0Q9KnYSVLc
This is kind of the merging point of the two videos where in that one you can see how the Linux kernel came about, merged with GNU, and learn just how prevalent GNU/Linux is today.
Anyway… what began as Richard Stallman’s vision has grown into a global movement that champions the values of freedom, collaboration, and community-driven innovation. The GNU Project and the GNU/Linux operating system have not only inspired countless developer and users, but also laid the foundation for a thriving free and open source software ecosystem.

I hope you enjoyed it! If I could ask a favor from those who made it this far and enjoyed this video, share it with your friends. The more I know y’all like it, the more inclined I am to make more episodes in the series. Also comment what software, or even hardware or other historical technologies you’d like to see in this series. I appreciate you all for the never-ending support. Until next time.

109,FBvyxc0PSlc,artificial intelligence ai robots breaking news chatgpt,"That’s it. AI has figured out how to be more human than humans. Scientists from Google and Stanford have created a virtual city inhabited by “generative agents” trained by ChatGPT.
These agents have the ability to draw conclusions about themselves, other agents, and their city by storing new information in memory. At the same time, the bots demonstrated “plausible” human behavior, for example, they coordinated plans, had meaningful conversations, and even “unwound” in the evenings at a bar.
The secret sauce behind these digital beings lies in the fusion of large language models with computational, interactive agents that possess the memory, reflection, and planning prowess of a chess grandmaster, simulating human behavior that seems real.
- Memory and retrieval allows agents to store a complete record of their experiences using natural language in a memory stream containing observations of their actions and others’ actions that they’re able to retrieve for current situations based on recency, importance, and relevance, selecting the top-k memories to pass to the language model.
- Reflection and summarization allows them to synthesize their memories over time into higher-level reflections that capture their opinions, feelings, and insights and use reflection triggers to decide when to generate a reflection, such as at the end of the day or after an important event. The agent then uses a summarization technique to compress the selected memories into a concise reflection that is added to the memory stream.
- Planning and execution allows them to use their memories and reflections to plan their future actions and achieve their goals using a planning trigger to decide when to generate a plan, such as at the start of the day or when facing a problem. They use a generation technique to produce a sequence of actions that form a plan that is added to the memory stream and executes that plan by selecting and performing one action at a time, while updating the memory stream with new observations.
The most important aspect here is the memory stream, because without it, nothing would be feasible and it would just be The Sims, with mindless bots roaming around with no intention or thought. That’s what allows these agents to not only engage in complex behavior, but having their actions rated more human than humans roleplaying.

In 2015, a non-profit company called OpenAI was founded by world-class research engineers and scientists, and funded by a group of the biggest names in Silicon Valley, who collectively donated $1B. 
They are the AI research and deployment company behind a couple products that you’ve probably heard of, like DALL-E-2 and ChatGPT. 
When founded, they had one goal in mind: to advance digital intelligence in the way that is most likely to benefit humanity as a whole, unconstrained by a need to generate financial return.
But earlier this year on January 23, 2023, OpenAI accepted a $10B investment from Microsoft, on top of Microsoft’s previous investment of $1 Billion dollars in 2019, making Microsoft a reported 49% stakeholder, receiving 75% of OpenAI’s profits until it secures its investment return. 
At face value, it looks like any other investment into a budding, thriving company. But is it? Because just after Microsoft’s initial investment in 2019, OpenAI legally restructured from a non-profit company to a “capped” for-profit company, with ongoing collaborations exclusively with Microsoft.
So, how did we get here? Why did OpenAI go from a non-profit for humanity to a for-profit that's heavily intertwined with Microsoft? And what has OpenAI accomplished?
Well in this video, that’s exactly what I’m going to talk about, and a whole lot more. From the founders, to the technological research and achievements, the products and funding, and how their mission has shifted overtime.
This is The Untold Story of OpenAI.

The talk about AI taking our programming jobs is everywhere. There are articles being written, social media going crazy, and comments on seemingly every one of my YouTube videos. And when I made my video about ChatGPT, I had two particular comments that stuck out to me. One was that someone wished I had included my opinion about AI in that video, and the other was asking if AI will make programmers obsolete in 5 years. This video is to do just that. And after learning, researching, and using many different AI tools over the last many months (a video about those tools coming soon), well let’s just say I have many thoughts on this topic. What AI can do for programmers right now. How it’s looking to progress in the near future. And will it make programmers obsolete in the next 5 years? Enjoy!!

The development of the Linux kernel and the GNU/Linux OS is one that every tech enthusiast should know.

From a hobby project in 1991 to one of the most widely used operating systems in the world, the development of Linux is a remarkable story of collaboration, innovation, and open-source software. Linux, for those that don’t know, is a community of open-source operating systems developed on top of the Linux kernel - the core of the operating system, responsible for managing resources, providing access to hardware, and communicating with other software. 
One could say it all started in 1991 when Linus Torvalds, a computer science student at the University of Helsinki, started working on the operating system as a hobby project. He was frustrated with the proprietary nature of existing operating systems and wanted to create a free and open-source alternative that anyone could use and contribute to. A kernel that could be independent of any OS and be used on his hardware, the new Intel 80386 microprocessor. But it began 22 years earlier. This is the story of the development of the Linux kernel and the GNU/Linux operating system.

I hope you enjoyed it. Making these videos about computer science history is quickly becoming a passion of mine, with many more to come, so if you liked this one, subscribe to the channel as I’m sure you’ll like the ones to come, like when we dive into the GNU project. Any and all recommendations for future videos are welcome in the comments. Until next time, y’all have a good one.

There are a lot of intro to cyber courses, but this one is special and I'm wicked hyped about it. Why special?? 🥳

📆 1. This is a full college level course that's designed to be 15 weeks long at 4 hours a week. (also fun fact it will be accredited by a higher education board in the next few months, but isn't officially yet).

✨ 2. It covers concepts, terminology, fundamentals like many other courses, 

💥but many courses leave out the connection to the reality of how those concepts are realized in a real business

🚨 so I applied my years of experience to provide context to the reality of those concepts (like the struggle of vuln mgmt, why you can't patch all the time, why budgets are underfunded, etc).

🧑‍💻 3. I have an entire module with several lectures on a cyber career itself, like what conferences to go to for what specialties, what certs apply to what roles, and yes why LinkedIn can have value for students.
 
🥼 4. I have 12 hands on labs that run the gamut from building an operating phishing capability to hiding data in pictures (and again, HOW this relates to reality of practicing cybersecurity).
 
I'm so excited. 🔥
It took 10 months to make. 😅
It was long nights and many weekends.😴
Its done, and it's going to have positive impact and I LOVE IT!! 💙

You can take several of the lectures and labs as a 'preview' to check out the content and see if its right for you.

💬 Prompt in ChatGPT for Python in Excel 
=======================
🤓 You are a distinguished data nerd that is an expert in both Python and Excel. 
🐍 Excel recently released a feature allowing the use of Python within it's program. 
💿 I have provided you an Excel spreadsheet familiarize yourself with the contents.
💬 When I provide you a prompt there is no need to ask if I'm ready. Just Do It.
🧑‍💻 I will be asking you questions and if it refers to python code I want you to provide me the results in the following format:
1. The expected results or visualizations
2. The full code snippet needed to insert into Excel
2a. When providing code snippets the last line of code in Python MUST be the output of the cell (whether a variable, or a chart)
2b. This last line does not require the use of the print() statement (a special feature of Python in Excel)
2c. The data has been loaded in the excel spreadsheet under the name 'jobs_df'
2d. The following is already imported in the environment (so don't re-import):
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import statsmodels as sm
import seaborn as sns
import excel

Why WPX Might Just Be The Ultimate Choice For WooCommerce Hosting 🚀

Ever felt bogged down with your hosting provider’s limitations, slow response times, and pesky technical issues? If so, it might be time for a switch. Let me introduce you to WPX, a game-changer in the hosting space. Here's why:

1. Speed Matters! 🌪️
WPX ensures your websites are blazing fast. Speed directly impacts user experience and, in the e-commerce world, a faster site translates to more sales.

2. The ""Fix It For You"" Guarantee 🛠️
Over 90% of WordPress issues are resolved on live chat in real-time. Whether it's images not loading or pages acting up, WPX has got you covered, often fixing problems before you're even aware of them!

3. Migration Made Simple 🧳
Switching hosts can be a hassle, but WPX offers free site migrations within 24 hours. No more prolonged downtimes!

4. Security Above All 🔐
With built-in malware scanning, daily scans, DDOS protection, and free SSLs, WPX ensures your site is always secure.

5. WooCommerce Plans: A Deep Dive 🛒
WooCommerce websites often demand more resources. WPX's new WooCommerce hosting plans are tailored to meet these demands, providing extra resources to handle higher traffic and transactions seamlessly.

For instance, the base level Power Store plan offers:

    20GB of storage
    300GB of bandwidth
    4GB RAM per site
    Four PHP workers and two CPU cores per site

These impressive stats ensure your WooCommerce site remains robust, even during peak traffic.

6. Exceeding Limits? No Worries! 📈
WPX has a flexible approach. If you exceed your resource limits temporarily, say during a festive sale, your site will continue to run smoothly. However, consistent overuse might warrant an upgrade, ensuring optimal performance.

7. Premium Features Galore 🌟
From solid-state storage, unlimited email boxes, two-factor authentication, 28 days of automatic backups to brute force protection – the list is endless. WPX offers premium features without the premium price tag.

Conclusion:
WPX isn't just another hosting provider. It's a comprehensive solution for those serious about their online presence, especially e-commerce platforms. The benefits, especially for WooCommerce site owners, are evident. With top-tier security, speed, and support, WPX stands out as an unbeatable option.

In the bustling world of website building and maintenance, AI Text Generation is revolutionizing the game, making content creation a breeze. As more and more people are stepping into the world of WordPress and Elementor, it becomes crucial to know how to make the best use of AI Text Generation in Elementor. This article serves as a companion to an insightful YouTube video that goes in-depth about this topic. Embed the YouTube video here to have a visual guide alongside the comprehensive information in this article.

The Exploration of AI Text Generation in Elementor:
In the free and Pro versions of Elementor, you can explore various widgets that allow you to add text using AI, optimizing the effectiveness of your content creation. When you click on the title widget, a star icon appears, opening a world where AI helps in generating text suggestions specific to the title.

As explored in the video, generating a blog title for a listicle on how to play pickleball exemplifies the potential of AI in text generation. A detailed prompt in AI results in more accurate and appealing text output, giving you a title like “Master the Game of Pickleball: 10 Tips for Beginners to Dominate the Court.” A detailed, catchy title like this is a hook in itself, promising the reader valuable insight and tips, increasing the chances of clicks and engagement.

Tailoring the Text:
Not every generated text will hit the mark in the first go. AI Text Generation tools within Elementor provide options to fine-tune your text, from simplifying the language to adjusting the length or even translating the text into different languages. You can always go back and modify the prompt or the generated text, ensuring the output is aligned with your vision and the expectations of your audience.

Creating a Blog Post with AI:
When creating a blog post, break it down into logical sections with H2 headings, thoroughly explaining each point, as shown in the video. For example, AI can generate a post covering 10 tips for mastering pickleball, each explained under a separate heading. This clear and structured format makes the post more readable and SEO-friendly, helping in higher search engine rankings.

Fine-Tuning the Content:
Despite the advancement in AI, the generated text may not always be perfect. You might need to simplify the language, make it longer or shorter, and fix spelling and grammar to make the text more coherent and appealing. Elementor AI provides these options, though they may not always yield the desired results as shown in the video, emphasizing the importance of human intervention in fine-tuning the AI-generated text.

Translation and Expansion:
For global reach, you can translate the generated text into different languages within Elementor AI. Moreover, you can expand on each section individually, making it longer to provide more detailed information, enhancing the quality and value of your blog post.",Elementor AI Features | Mastering Web Design with AI 🚀,3.0,14.0,474,Education

Hello, WordPress beginners! In today's video, we'll explore Elementor CSS AI, a feature that only pro users of Elementor can access. This tool allows you to add custom CSS to various elements on your website, ensuring it looks just the way you want it to. This post is a companion to the in-depth YouTube tutorial on the same topic, so be sure to check out the video for a visual walkthrough of the process. Let’s dive in!

This quote holds especially true when working with CSS selectors. With Elementor CSS AI, simplicity is the goal, but there's still a learning curve to ensure your website operates smoothly.

What is Elementor CSS AI?

Elementor CSS AI lets pro users click into any section or element on their site to access a custom CSS box within the advanced tab. This feature enables easy customization of individual page elements, but it's essential to understand the concept of selectors to use it effectively.

CSS Selectors: The Basics

Selectors are like addresses on your webpage that point to specific content. For instance, to style a heading, you can use 'H1' or 'H2' as your selector. But if you want to target a particular class, you must use the exact name, such as 'elementor-heading-title.'

The Challenge: Managing CSS Rules

Here’s your challenge: As you work with Elementor CSS AI, strive to maintain organization and clarity in your CSS rules. It’s easy to create a web of confusing, conflicting rules if you're not careful, leading to a messy backend and a website that doesn’t look or function as it should.

Why Organization Matters

Applying CSS to individual elements may seem convenient now, but imagine searching for specific rules a year down the line. If you have CSS rules scattered all over, locating and editing them can become a nightmare. This disorganization can lead to conflicting rules and a disjointed site appearance.

A Pro Tip

While Elementor allows for point-and-click style adjustments, consider making CSS changes on the main stylesheet instead. This practice keeps all your CSS in one place, making life significantly easier for both developers and end-users. It might mean a bit more work now, but it’s worth it for streamlined site maintenance in the future.

Remember:
Understand CSS selectors for effective site customization.
Keep CSS rules organized to avoid future confusion and conflict.
Consider making all CSS adjustments on the main stylesheet for a streamlined, easy-to-manage website.
Are you ready to master Elementor CSS AI and take your WordPress site to the next level? Take up the challenge and begin your journey to a more organized, efficient, and effective website today!

The future of design is now leaping bounds with AI image generators. But how does the brand new Elementor AI image generator fare against others like Mid Journey? Let's delve into the comparison, much like the embedded YouTube video exploration, and uncover the capabilities and features of the Elementor AI Image Generator.

Beginning the Elementor Journey
Drag and drop an image widget and clicking on the AI icon, you embark on the exploration of the Elementor AI image generator. As you click 'Get Started', an array of images starts to unfold. This initiation brings forth the ease and flexibility that Elementor seems to offer, a plus for WordPress beginners looking to create appealing and engaging images for their sites.

Testing with Personal Touch
What better way to evaluate an AI image generator than with a personal project? Creating stickers with the theme of a cute cartoon dragon combined with a unicorn on a white background might seem like child’s play. However, it’s a legitimate gauge to compare Elementor and Mid Journey. The quest for the perfect cute dragon and unicorn image uncovers the various options and styles you can choose from with Elementor, ranging from digital art to cartoon, each offering a new facet and perspective to the image.

The Exploration of Styles and Aspect Ratios
The myriad of styles and aspect ratios available opens up a world of possibilities. Though Elementor, still in its beta phase, managed to nail the dragon and unicorn image, it's the fine-tuning and the specificity where Mid Journey takes the lead. The emphasis on details, the exactness of the horn, and the presentation of the dragons and unicorns make a considerable difference in the outcome.

A Delve into Other Imagery
From Fantasy Art to Comic Book Styles

Shifting settings, experimenting with fantasy art, and comic book styles in Elementor presents a breadth of variety. But even with no quota on image generation, getting that super cute dragon still seems elusive. Despite the numerous trials, the perfect cute dragon image remains a search, whereas Mid Journey's images appear more attuned to specific instructions.

Logos and Business Impressions

When testing for a business logo that exudes success, Elementor offers options, yet not as crisp and distinct as those from Mid Journey. The definition of a 'logo that screams success' is subjective, yet the clarity and precision in design hold paramount importance, making Mid Journey a favorable choice.

Exploring Portraits: A Search for Arnold
The journey continues with a quest to generate images of Arnold Schwarzenegger running on a treadmill. The outcomes from Elementor, though varied, miss the mark in capturing Arnold’s likeness. Despite adjustments and new prompts, the generated images fall short of expectations. Meanwhile, Mid Journey seems to have a better grasp, presenting more lifelike and accurate depictions.",Elementor AI Features | Mastering Web Design with AI 🚀,3.0,35.0,844,Education

Expanded description: 

Elementor AI has burst onto the scene with the promise of simplifying web development by generating custom code automatically, a tempting offer that has caught the attention of many. In the world of WordPress, where simplicity and efficiency reign supreme, it’s easy to see why this could be a game-changer. But does it live up to its promise? Let's dissect the user experience as narrated in the embedded YouTube video, and separate the hype from reality.

Exploring the Custom Code Feature

As a WordPress beginner navigating the ocean of plugins and widgets, Elementor AI appears to be a beacon of light. The concept is straightforward: hover over Elementor on your dashboard sidebar, click on custom code, and let the AI do the coding for you.

The AI provides multiple prompts and examples, like embedding a PDF into a webpage. However, when attempting to follow through, the AI admits its limitation, noting its inability to embed PDF files into a webpage as HTML code. The generated instructions direct users to provide a clickable link to the PDF file on your webpage instead. A helpful solution? Not exactly what was advertised.

Challenge

Your Challenge: Test the Elementor AI by trying to embed a PDF into your webpage using the AI-generated code. Can you find a workaround for the AI’s limitations, or do you also find the AI to be unhelpful?

Navigating Other Features

Let's delve deeper. The AI promises a code for embedding a Spotify widget and setting up a Facebook pixel. Both attempts prove to be unsatisfactory. The Spotify widget instructions guide users to the Spotify platform to copy the embed code, while the Facebook pixel setup requires manual insertion of your pixel ID. The AI fails to deliver on its promises, proving to be more of a guide than a code generator.

In another test, the Elementor AI promises to generate code to make a website header sticky. The result? An entire HTML page is generated, requiring the user to sift through the code to identify what is needed. For a WordPress beginner or someone uncomfortable with code, this output is far from helpful.

In Conclusion: Is Elementor AI Worth the Investment?

Despite numerous attempts and different use cases, the Elementor AI consistently falls short of expectations, as vividly shared in the YouTube video. It generates excessive HTML code, misses steps, and requires manual intervention – a far cry from the automated code generation it promises.

So, is it worth spending your valuable AI credits? As per the video narrative, it doesn’t seem so. With a score of six strikeouts out of six attempts, the Elementor AI custom code feature may not be ready to deliver its grand promises.

If you’re on the fence about trying Elementor AI, consider the experience shared in the video and weigh the potential benefits against the clear limitations. There's always room for improvement, and while the Elementor AI may enhance its features in the future, it's essential to approach with realistic expectations.",Elementor AI Features | Mastering Web Design with AI 🚀,4.0,24.0,567,Education

In this coding time lapse video, I've concentrated 5 hours of coding into a 20 minute time lapse. In it, I build a responsive News website and explain my thought process from start to finish. I used CSS grid and subgrid for the layout, and built an accessible animated hamburger menu. The design is from Frontend Mentor and you can check out my source code below!

*Note: at 1:26 I mistakenly said that you can't create a GitHub repo in a non-empty folder. I was thinking about how you can't clone into a non-empty folder. You can create a repo in any folder, whether it's empty or has files.

In this video you'll see me set up a real world website project in VS Code that uses Sass/SCSS, JS and Gulp. This is a series building a Frontend Mentor challenge from scratch.

The ability to solve an SQL query using multiple solutions can help you to get better at SQL since you will be able to apply different concepts of SQL to solve the same problem and also it can be beneficial during interviews.

During SQL interviews, it is very common for the interviewer to ask you to not not use a specific concept when solving a SQL query or you may be asked to provide multiple solutions to the same SQL problem hence this video will be a good example to practice solving SQL queries where you provide multiple different solutions to the same SQL problem.

Under this tutorial, we have make one HTML button and when we have click on that button then it will send request to Node js server code by using JavaScript fetch API. So when request has been send then JavaScript Fetch API we have to send JWT token data in headers of request and we have already store JWT token data in localStorage. Now at Node.js server side we will make one middleware which will receive JWT token data from HTTP header and that middleware will decode JWT token data and store under request.user variable. Next will will add this middleware in Node.js route so when we have send request to this route then first middleware code will execute and if JWT token data successfully decoded then this route will send back data to client in JSON format.

In this video, you'll learn how to implement secure user authentication using JWT tokens in a Node.js application. We'll cover everything from hashing passwords to generating JWT tokens and implementing a logout mechanism.

First, we'll dive into the process of securely storing user passwords by hashing them using industry-standard techniques. Then, we'll create a robust authentication system that verifies user credentials against the hashed passwords stored in our database.

Once the user credentials are validated, we'll generate a JWT (JSON Web Token) to provide secure access to protected routes in our application. You'll learn how to sign and verify JWT tokens to ensure their integrity and authenticity.

Furthermore, we'll explore how to send the generated JWT token to the client-side application, where it will be securely stored using local storage. This token will be used to authenticate subsequent requests to protected endpoints.

Finally, we'll implement a logout feature that invalidates the JWT token on the server-side, ensuring that users can securely log out of the application and prevent unauthorized access.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced developer, this tutorial will equip you with the knowledge and skills needed to implement secure user authentication in your Node.js applications using JWT tokens.

Many beginners don't know there's a MUCH better way to debug their Java programs, and it's built into Eclipse and every other modern IDE.

The Eclipse debug tools make debugging your Java programs incredibly simple and (dare I say it) even fun.

In this beginner's Java tutorial video, we'll do a full walkthrough of using the Eclipse Debugging tools.

410,IvnqCG1l8RE,Google Cloud Storage BigQuery External Table CSV files Data Analysis Data Visualization Data Sharing Google Cloud Platform Google Drive Google Sheets Google Spreadsheet BigQuery Tutorial Data Analysis Tutorial Data Visualization Tutorial Data Sharing Tutorial,"In this video, we will learn how to read multiple CSV files from a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket in BigQuery by using an external table. BigQuery is a powerful tool that allows you to access, analyze, visualize, and share billions of rows of data from your spreadsheet with Connected Sheets, the new BigQuery data connector.
To get started, you need to meet all of the following requirements: Access to the Google Cloud platform, BigQuery access, and a project with billing setup in BigQuery. Once you have met these requirements, you can create an external table in BigQuery that references the CSV files in your GCS bucket. You can then query the external table as if it were a native BigQuery table.
To create an external table, you need to specify the schema of the CSV files and the location of the GCS bucket. You can also specify other options such as the delimiter, the number of header rows, and the file format. Once you have created the external table, you can query it using standard SQL syntax.
Using external tables has several advantages over loading data into BigQuery. First, external tables allow you to query data without incurring the cost of loading it into BigQuery. Second, external tables allow you to query data in real-time, so you can always access the latest data in your GCS bucket. Finally, external tables allow you to query data across multiple GCS buckets and projects.

BigQuery is a powerful tool that allows you to access, analyze, visualize, and share billions of rows of data from your spreadsheet with Connected Sheets, the new BigQuery data connector.
To get started, you need to meet all of the following requirements: Access to the Google Cloud Platform, BigQuery access, and a project with billing setup in BigQuery. Once you have met these requirements, you can create a BigQuery table with the data source Google Drive document (URL of Google Spreadsheet). After the schema is recognized, the data from Google Sheets is visible in BigQuery. You can then run a query to display all of your data.
Connected Sheets runs queries on BigQuery on your behalf either when manually requested or on a defined schedule. The results of those queries are saved in your spreadsheet for analysis and sharing. You can also use Connected Sheets to collaborate with partners, analysts, or other stakeholders in a familiar spreadsheet interface.

Hi everyone, in today's video we'll be talking about working with private and sensitive data. A lot of times data scientists do not work on the most valuable and ""cool"" datasets, simply because these datasets contain too sensitive individual information. I have encountered this many times at my work, and it's frustrating! In this video, I will give you a brief introduction to different techniques for handling senstive data, and how to implement them using Antigranular platform. 

Thank you for watching! 😇

Hi everyone, in today's video I'm making a deepdive into how to use generative AI tools inside Jupyter Notebook 🤩. These tools can help you speed up the data wrangling and explorative analysis process, and let you focus on the more important analyses. However, these tools are not (yet) perfect and there are several concerns, which I also discussed later in the video. Hope this video is helpful! Thank you for watching 😇.

Honestly, I feel a bit restless these days by the recent AI developments. It is very exciting and terrifying at the same time. Hence, I dove into this topic and did some research, with the hope to understand a bit better what's going on. AI risks are sometimes so conceptual and hard to put into words. So I hope this video will give you a glimpse of the discussions around these difficult topics and what still needs to be done to help make AI really benefit humans, instead of doing harm. 

Hope you enjoyed the vid! 🤗

Hey data nerds 👋, in this video I'm talking about how I use iPad Pro for learning data science. I really enjoy watching videos, reading books, taking study notes and even coding (!) on an iPad. Honestly, I tend to get lazy and procrastinate a lot when working/ studying by myself. This iPad has helped me against procrastination because I actually think it is fun to use it. Even though it costs a lot of money (to me), I still think it's been a great investment overall.

Hey data nerds 👋, greetings from my hometown in Vietnam!! JupyterLab is a great tool for data science, but it has its own limitations.. big ones 😅.. Due to the fact that you can execute cells in different orders, it's easy to make mistakes and mess up the output. From my experience, it could be a big challenge to use JupyterLab in a complex data science project. In this video, I'm sharing with you about Link, a JupyterLab extension that helps us easily create pipelines in JupyterLab and share them with other people. This extension helps address the reproducibility issue of JupyterLab, and makes it easy to share results. While walking you through the how-to of this extension, I also tried to give a brief introduction to neural style transfer algorithm, which is what I implemented in this sample notebook. 

Let me know what you think about this extension and whether you would consider using it in your projects. Thank you for watching and have a great day! 🤗

Use the Keltner Channel Trading Strategy to Buy and Sell an asset. 

A Keltner Channel strategy is a way of trading based on the Keltner Channel indicator, which is a volatility-based technical indicator that uses bands to identify when a market has stretched too far from the moving average. The strategy is to buy if the price breaks above the upper band or sell short if the price drops below the lower band. The middle band is used as the exit point for the trade.

Mean Reversion Trading Strategy Using Python:
In this video you will learn how to create a simple mean reversion trading strategy for an asset using the python programming language. According to Investopedia, mean reversion, or reversion to the mean, is a theory used in finance (rooted in a concept well known as regression towards the mean) that suggests that asset price volatility and historical returns eventually will revert to the long-run mean or average level of the entire dataset.

In a recent paper he outlined the path to AGI, and in the paper we go over today we'll talk about the common requirements for an interdisciplinary approach to an intelligent agent.

I'm referencing this paper here:

Creating novel agents to conquer the most advanced environments requires the use of some sophisticated infrastructure. Fortunately for us mere mortals, they've open sourced their framework for designing deep reinforcement learning agents: ACME. 

In ACME, you'll find everything from deep Q learning all the way up to the R2D2 algorithm. Better yet, it includes all the building blocks to start creating your own custom agents. 

In this tutorial, I'll show you how to setup ACME and get started making our own deep Q learning and deep deterministic policy gradient agent.

In computer architecture , the term instruction format is used in the context of computer program and how processor executes the program instructions.

The instruction format is defined as standard machine instruction format that can be directly decoded and executed by the Central processing unit CPU. 
The instruction format, is simply a sequence of bits, contained in a machine instruction, that defines the layout of the instruction.

Each field of the machine instruction provides specific information to the CPU regarding the operation to be performed and the location of the data.
An instruction format is also defied as layout or pattern of bits in the machine instruction that directs the CPU to decode and execute the instruction.
In other words , the instruction format defines the layout of the bits for the instruction. The  instruction formats supported by the CPU depends upon the instruction set architecture ( ISA ) implemented by the processor.
In this tutorial , you will learn what is instruction format , how CPU decodes and execute the instruction , different types of instruction formats and other related important topics.

Fundamental Object Oriented Programming ( OOP ) Concepts Explained.

What Class And Object ?
What Is OOP Paradigm ?

Welcome to learn computer science online dot com  and in this video  we are going to discuss  what is object oriented programming. It also commonly abbreviated as OOP. 
The object oriented programming, is an approach to the computer programming that is based on the, concept of object and the class.
The OOP programming paradigm was developed  in order to overcome the limitations of the procedural programming.
Most students begin their programming journey with the conventional procedural programming language such as C programming language.
However , the procedural programming had some major limitations. In conventional procedural programming, It was difficult to develop a large and complex software.
The OOP program organization, allows the programmer, to protect, the key data elements. 
In OOP programming , The data can be protected by restricting its access to only methods that belong to the object.
The OOP programming approach, views the program components in the form of objects. Each object defined in the program can have its own data and the methods that can operate on the data. 
This is just an introduction to the, object oriented programming and  we are going to discuss each of this topic in detail in this tutorial.
In this tutorial, you will learn what is object oriented programming , some important fundamental OOP concepts such as the concept of a class and the objects.

We will also discuss in detail the four important fundamental OOP program design principles such as  encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and the polymorphism.

Functions And Types Of System Software.


The system software is a software used by the computer system for its internal management.

The system software is also alternately referred to as, system program.
The system software are computer programs developed specially to operate various hardware components connected to the, computer system.
The operating system itself is a type of system software .
The operating system is essential component of every computer system and, the first system program, that gets loaded, into the memory  each time, the system is powered on.
The operating system is responsible to manage, and control all the system resources, that includes, all hardware, and, software components.
However , the operating system internally use another set of system software components to communicate with the different hardware components.
The hardware components are, physical parts of the system, which we can see, and, these components are  physically connected to the system.
The computer user, does not directly interact with the system software and other system software components  that are internally used by the operating system to drive various hardware components.

Let us now take a quick look at, different types of, system software used, by the computer system.
The system software can be grouped into two main types.
The first type of system software, is internally used by the computer system for the management of the computer system itself.
On the other hand ,
The second type of system software is used by the programmers and the software developers for the development of the software.
The first type of system software include  the operating system , device drivers , BIOS , UEFI, used to , boot the system and, other system utility programs such as antivirus software used to clean the system and the disk compression and  disk cleaners.
The device driver is system program internally used by the operating system to drive, different internal and external hardware components. 

The second type of system software include programming languages for writing the program code  program compilers and, interpreters that translates the high level program code  into the binary low level machine code .

(Thanks to https://twitter.com/zumersultana/status/1704103754692440445)

Turn ChatGPT into Alex Hormozi:

First prompt:

Act as Alex Hormozi and rate my offer.

For context, my offer is to:

[DESCRIBE YOUR OFFER]

You should rate my offer based on Alex Hormozi's 4-part value equation framework:

1) How desirable is this offer's dream outcome from a scale of 1-100? (""Dream Score"")
2) How high is the offer's perceived likelihood of achievement on a scale of 1-100? (""Success Score"")
3) How high is the offer's perceived time delay between purchasing the product and reaching the promised achievement on a scale from 0 to 1? (""Time Score"") The higher the time delay, the higher the score. Ideally, the perceived time delay should be as low as possible.
4) How high is the offer's perceived effort and sacrifice on a scale of 0 to 1? (""Effort Score"") The higher the perceived effort, the higher the score. Ideally, the perceived effort and sacrifice should be as low as possible.

After rating each of the 4 components, calculate an ""offer score"", which is calculated like this:

1) Multiply ""Dream Score"" with  ""Success Score"" 
2) Multiply ""Time score"" with ""Effort Score""
3) Divide the product of the Dream & Success score with the product of the Time and Effort Score to get the ""offer score""

In your output, provide actionable advice for how I can tweak my offer to get a higher score on each of the 4 components of the value equation framework.

Also advice me on 2 other offer structures with higher offer score that I could consider instead of my current one, and explain why they have a higher score.
---
Second prompt:
Tweak this offer as much as you want so that it reaches a  perfect offer score of 1,000,000 

(Dream Score = 100, Success Score = 100, Time Score = 0.1, Effort Score = 0.1)
----

Summary by ChatGPT:
- AI development is advancing rapidly and AI systems are becoming more intelligent than humans.
- GPT stands for ""Generative Pre-trained Transformer"" and is an AI language model that generates words and text based on large data sets of texts that it memorizes from the internet.
- Parameters are values that computer programs learn on their own during training to help them make predictions on new data.
- AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) is the next step in AI development, where machines are capable of performing a wide range of intellectual tasks that were once limited to humans.
- The development of Auto GPT, a fully autonomous AI system, has raised concerns about the potential for machines to act against humanity, as seen in an example where one user programmed an agent to destroy humanity. 
- However, there are also positive use cases, such as developing a podcast or an e-commerce business.",,4.0,25.0,692,Science & Technology

In this video, we will explore six free AI tools that can help you achieve success. The first tool we examine is Playground AI, a new AI tool that provides a thousand free pictures per day. We test the tool and try to generate a robot image with a glassy look and a smile. We also check out Instantart.io, a picture generator tool. However, the tool fails to work despite our attempt to generate a white female robot image. We then move on to the next tool, Pickfinder.ai, where we generate various pictures of white female robots with glassy looks and smiles. The tool is free, and we can download the pictures we generate. Next, we explore Blue Willow, another picture generator tool that operates on Discord. We test the tool by generating various images of white female robots and examine the different variations produced. The final two tools we look at are OpenAI's GPT-3 and Hugging Face, which we demonstrate by typing in prompts to generate text. With these six AI tools, you can achieve more and get things done quickly and efficiently.",,11.0,51.0,1165,Science & Technology

Do you like memes? I love memes like this one or that one or this one.
AI Meme generator

There is an artificial intelligence tool you can use to produce memes like these. So there is this tool called supermeme.ai. It’s an amazing tool where you can start for free, and it’s an artificial intelligence that produces memes for your success. So you click on, start for free, and then you make an account.

You go to text to meme, for example, and you just type in any text. You want to choose. For example, when an AI takes over your job, you click on generate and you get like a few free, super memes there. and the AI has produced these memes. When the AI takes your job, when the AI takes your job, I love it. When you’re replaced by an AI, when the AI is better at your job than you are.

Oh my God. It’s so good. Let’s type in just one word, blockchain. So blockchain is like a spreadsheet. when somebody tries to explain blockchain to me, . Type in YouTube when YouTube and boring, when you’re so bored of YouTube, that you start watching videos on Instagram, you can even edit it afterwards and exchange the text here.

• Today how is Data Science & Jobs Market in US and please share with our listeners about your technology journey ?

Michael Haydock specializes in the areas of Machine Learning and Numerical Optimization to serve Customer Contact Strategies and Supply Chain Intelligence to IBM clients. Michael’s role within the practice is to develop innovative application capabilities which leverage high performance computing technologies appropriate for massive data manipulation and advanced numerical analysis in business settings where time to critical decision provides IBM clients with a key competitive advantage. 

Michael’s research interests have focused on the application of mathematical optimization, machine learning and business cognitive computing solutions to complex market risk and marketing management problems. Implementing these marketing solutions for clients typically required the additional step of mathematically reengineering their customer contact delivery systems to meet the new requirements of the target customer base. Having had direct responsibility for complex customer interactions as the CEO of a publicly traded company, Michael saw the opportunity to link demand chain innovations in computational marketing with real-time customer service requirements using numerical optimization methods in an effort to maximize the top line revenue of an enterprise. This solution set attempts to address the complexities in aligning customer insight models with real-time customer interaction models as an emerging business issue of chief marketing officers and chief executives in many corporations. 

Michael has worked with industrial clients in retail direct mail, retail store, food and beverage, agricultural chemicals, financial services, insurance, health care, telecommunications, aerospace and transportation. He holds a U.S. Patent in “Efficient Customer Contact Strategies” and has published work in several journals detailing the application of mathematical methods in efficient customer treatments and improvements to optimize supply chains in the service of those customers. These treatment strategies use marketing automation and portfolio management techniques to synchronize business responses across multiple retail contact channels or customer “touch points” and numerical optimization techniques to insure the proper resource allocation is met at minimum risk. Recent work has also included innovations in the area of multi-dimensional clustering and machine learning focused on the use of external data to explain customer behavior and unusual product demand movements.  A highly regarded paper initially introducing the specialized area of longitudinal marketing strategy appears in “Industrial Applications in Operations Research” (MacMillan & Press). 

Michael has served as President, Chief Executive Officer and a member of the Board of Directors of Cray Research. Prior to leading the turnaround at Cray, Michael served as a Vice President of the IBM Company leading the Sell & Support Solutions Practice, having built at the time the largest solutions consulting practice in IBM’s Global Services Division. Prior to joining IBM, Michael held various marketing management and executive positions at Control Data Corporation, where he was primarily engaged in applying supercomputing and numerical methods and solutions to both business and scientific issues. While at Control Data, Michael also lead the world wide efforts of the Numerical Weather Sciences Division, which supplied large scale scientific computing products and services to more than 100 governments and weather agencies. He has participated in the United Nations World Weather Organization in Geneva, Switzerland. Michael has served on the Board of Directors at Decision Intelligence, Avaki, and Revolution Computing, and has advised several venture capital groups specializing in the technology markets.  Michael holds both a Bachelor of Science and Master of Science degrees with specialization in Marketing from Florida Atlantic University (Boca Raton, FL) and a Doctor of Philosophy degree from Walden University (Minneapolis, MN) with a specialization in Operations Research.  Michael resides with his family in Chanhassen, MN.

What is machine learning? Is Machine Learning sentient already ?

Machine learning is a concept or a  practice of implementing the probabilistic and statistical methods to devices which appear to function seamlessly in order to provide meaningful outcomes. 

Dimensions are the capacity to represent the degree of data. For example,  imagine a family chart and the features of each person in that as a degree. Compression also describes the dimensions to how many layers data Is encrypted. 

The number of input variables or feature columns in the given data said are dimensions in machine learning for example salary of employees based on skills and years of experience.

What is Clustering in machine learning ?
In machine learning we often group examples as a first step to understand data sets, this grouping of unlabeled data points is clustering. 

Some examples are ad campaigns, customer segmentation, and building recommender systems.

What is Classification in Machine Learning - 

Classification is a technique which is used to identify and classify the objects with similar features. These classifications are then stored and used for further inferencing, for example using classification models for things like image recognition and customer retention. At times, classification is based on variables in the data sets.  For example, establishing the class of an object based on the relationship between a dependent and a set of independent variables. 

What is Regression in Machine Learning ?

Regression is a statistical method , Using this statistical method we can establish the strength in the relationship among two or more variables. For example, we can regress to predict the likelihood of attempting the login activity into an account, when the password is hacked.

Dimensions and clustering are both part of unsupervised learning. 
Whereas, classification and regression are both part of supervised learning.

The main difference between supervise learning and unsupervised learning is that there is a set of rules to refer in case of a supervised learning or while running a supervisor model, like eye in an image has to be a match to eyes in another image or a dataset of images. 

On the other hand Unsupervised learning is a model running without a set of rules and with a goal of identifying certain characteristics / unknown data points in unlabeled data set .  

Both of these are a way of common machine learning techniques and are helpful in decision making . 

Some of the common machine learning algorithm are 
1. Linear model 
2. Tree based
3. Neural networks


At the end of the day we know that Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence. With feature engineering, building models, training datasets, and targeted modeling etc., the ability of devices to communicate can be augmented.",What is Artificial Intelligence ?,,8.0,22347,Science & Technology

Speakers - Shalawn king and Matt Mondics from IBM Systems
Topic - OpenShift on IBM zSystems with Linux

IBM Enterprise Systems: your choice IT infrastructure for hybrid multi-cloud 

The IBM®️ zSystems and IBM LinuxONE are the most trusted platforms on the market. They modernize your IT with unmatched uptime, security and performance necessary for today's most critical workloads. 

IBM LinuxONE III offers open enterprise Linux your way, with the flexibility and control that comes with open source development built on the proven architecture of the IBM zSystems. 

What is Open Shift ? 
- OpenShift is a family of containerization software products developed by Red Hat. Its flagship product is the OpenShift Container Platform — a hybrid cloud platform as a service built around Linux containers orchestrated and managed by Kubernetes on a foundation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

What is open Shift Container Platform ? 
- OpenShift Container Platform is a private platform-as-a-service (PaaS) for enterprises that run OpenShift on public cloud or on-premises infrastructure. It runs on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) operating system and functions as a set of Docker-based application containers managed with Kubernetes orchestration. 

What is hybrid multicloud? 
- Hybrid Cloud ; A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a private cloud and a public cloud by allowing applications and data to be shared between them. 
Multicloud ; Multicloud is a cloud approach made up of more than one cloud service, from more than one cloud vendor—public or private. 
Hybrid Multicloud = Hybrid Cloud + Multicloud ; A hybrid multicloud combines a private cloud, a public cloud and more than The most relevant applications of AI today involve near real-time data interpretation and decision-making—or inference—to meet critical business needs. We must lean on AI to make inferences about what exactly should be done to resolve complex problems, help customers, or drive new opportunities when moments matter. 

What is zIIP and IFL? - The IBM zSystems Integrated Information Processor (zIIP) is a special purpose processor. It was initially introduced to relieve the general mainframe central processors of specific Database workloads, but currently is used to offload other z/OS workloads as described below. The idea originated with previous special purpose processors, the zAAP, which offloads Java processing, and the IFL, which runs Linux and z/VM but not other IBM operating systems such as z/OS, DOS/VSE and TPF. A System z PU (processor unit) is ""characterized"" as one of these processor types, or as a CP (Central Processor), or SAP (System Assist Processor). The IBM zSystems Integrated Information Processor (zIIP) is a special purpose processor. It was initially introduced to relieve the general mainframe central processors of specific DB2 workloads. Although Db2 for z/OS was the first product released that exploited zIIP processors, it is not limited to just Db2 or IBM products. The zIIP specialty CPU can also be used for IPSec processing in Transaction Control Protocol/ Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), certain general extensible markup language (XML) processing, and IBM's Scalable Architecture for Financial Reporting. The Integrated Facility for Linux (IFL) is a specialty engine processor on IBM System z mainframe servers that is dedicated to Linux workloads. Operational efforts, software costs, energy use and hardware footprint are reduced when Linux is deployed on IFL rather than general-purpose processors. What is most relevant to an AI engineer? - The speed and performance of how AI is trained to respond to huge volumes of incoming data at each decision point are critical. 

What is most important for a business leader while implementing AI ? 
- AI’s value for improving quality of service, bringing new competitive differentiation to market, and avoiding risk are paramount. 

What's the goal for all enterprise constituents ? 
- The causes and effects of these critical decision points are already manifested on the mainframe—the digital backbone of the business. 
• Inference/scoring within transaction (Less then 10ms) to be relevant to customers 
• Most data is text/number, some speech, some pictures at this point 
• Currently AI workload focused on machine learning 
• Ongoing transition to deep learning convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) (explainability)

It empowers enterprises to continuously address and resolve customer and employee inquiries across multiple channels with ease.

What is conversational AI?

Conversational artificial intelligence (AI) refers to technologies, like chatbots or virtual agents, which users can talk to. They use large volumes of data, machine learning, and natural language processing to help imitate human interactions, recognizing speech and text inputs and translating their meanings across various languages.

Components of conversational AI

Conversational AI combines natural language processing (NLP) with machine learning. These NLP processes flow into a constant feedback loop with machine learning processes to continuously improve the AI algorithms. Conversational AI has principle components that allow it to process, understand, and generate response in a natural way.

Machine Learning (ML) is a sub-field of artificial intelligence, made up of a set of algorithms, features, and data sets that continuously improve themselves with experience. As the input grows, the AI platform machine gets better at recognizing patterns and uses it to make predictions.

Natural language processing is the current method of analyzing language with the help of machine learning used in conversational AI. Before machine learning, the evolution of language processing methodologies went from linguistics to computational linguistics to statistical natural language processing. In the future, deep learning will advance the natural language processing capabilities of conversational AI even further.

NLP consists of four steps:

Input generation: Users provide input through a website or an app; the format of the input can either be voice or text.
Input analysis: If the input is text-based, the conversational AI solution app will use natural language understanding (NLU) to decipher the meaning of the input and derive its intention. However, if the input is speech-based, it’ll leverage a combination of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and NLU to analyze the data.
Dialogue management: During this stage, Natural Language Generation (NLG), a component of NLP, formulates a response
Reinforcement learning: Finally, machine learning algorithms refine responses over time to ensure accuracy
How to create conversational AI
Conversational AI starts with thinking about how your potential users might want to interact with your product and the primary questions that they may have. You can then use conversational AI tools to help route them to relevant information. In this section, we’ll walk through ways to start planning and creating a conversational AI.

Frequently asked questions are the foundation of the conversational AI development process. They help you define the main needs and concerns of your end users, which will, in turn, alleviate some of the call volume for your support team. If you don’t have a FAQ list available for your product, then start with your customer success team to determine the appropriate list of questions that your conversational AI can assist with.
For example, let’s say you’re a bank. Your starting list of FAQs might be:

How do I access my account?
Where do I find my routing and account number?
When will my debit card arrive?
How do I activate my debit card?
How do I order checks?
How do I talk to a local banker?",IBM,1.0,519.0,61515,Science & Technology

According to the IBM process for data science, after a satisfactory model is developed and is approved by the business sponsors, it’s deployed into the production environment or a comparable test environment. Usually, it’s deployed in a limited way until its performance has been fully evaluated.

Using the Machine Learning service of Watson Studio, you can deploy your model in three different ways: as a web service, as a batch program, or as a real-time streaming prediction. In this tutorial, we deploy it as a web service and then test it interactively.

Once the model is deployed it can be used for prediction. However, before using it in a production environment it might be worthwhile to test it using real data. You can do this interactively or programmatically using the API for the Watson Machine Learning service. We discuss using the API in another tutorial of this learning path, but for now we continue testing it interactively.

There are two ways to interactively test the prediction: by entering the values one by one in distinct fields (one for each feature) or to specify all of the feature values using a JSON object. We use the second option because it’s the most convenient one when tests are performed more than once (which is usually the case), and when a large set of feature values is needed.

Notice that the JSON object defines the names of the fields first, followed by a sequence of observations to be predicted, each in the form of a sequence.

Be aware that some of the features, such as state and phone number, are expected to be in the form of strings (which should be no surprise), whereas the true numerical features can be provided as integers or floats as appropriate for the given feature.

To test the model at run time:

1. Select the deployment that you just created by clicking the deployment name (for example, ‘customer-churn-manual-web-deployment’).
2. deployment-list
3. This opens a new page showing you an overview of the properties of the deployment (for example, name, creation date, and status).
4. Select the Test tab.
5. Select the file icon, which allows you to enter the values using JSON.
6. Paste the sample JSON object into the Enter input data field.
7. Click Predict to view the results. 

The result of the prediction is given in terms of the probability For example, the customer will churn (True) or not (False). You can try it with other values, for example by substituting the values with values taken from the ‘csv’ file. Another test would be to change the phone number to something like “XYZ” and then run the prediction again. The result of the prediction should be the same, which indicates that the feature is not a factor in the prediction.

Feature engineering is the process of using the knowledge to choose variables wisely for extracting features from raw data. The motivation is to use these extra features to improve the quality of results from a machine learning process, compared with supplying only the raw data to the machine learning process.  A correlation analysis is helpful when doing feature engineering. 

Ques - What is Feature Engineering ?
Ans - Feature engineering is a machine learning technique that leverages data to create new variables that aren't in the training set.

Ques - Why feature engineering is important in machine learning?
Ans - Feature engineering in machine learning is more than selecting the appropriate features and transforming them. Not only does feature engineering prepare the data set to be compatible with the algorithm, but it also improves the performance of the machine learning models.

Ques - What are the different types of features in machine learning?
Ans - There are three distinct types of features: quantitative, ordinal, and categorical.These feature types can be ordered in terms of how much information they convey. Quantitative features have the highest information capacity followed by ordinal, and categorical. Patterns are Range, variance, standard deviation for Quantitative; Quantiles for Ordinal and Boolean for Catagorical.",NEW YORK,1.0,,74,Science & Technology

AutoAI process

Using AutoAI, you can build and deploy a machine learning model with sophisticated training features and no coding. The tool does most of the work for you.

To view the code that created a particular experiment, or interact with the experiment programmatically, you can save an experiment as a notebook.

The AutoAI process takes data from a structured file, prepares the data, selects the model type, and generates and ranks pipelines so you can save and deploy a model.

AutoAI automatically runs the following tasks to build and evaluate candidate model pipelines:

1. Data pre-processing
2. Automated model selection
3. Automated feature engineering
4. Hyperparameter optimization

Understanding the AutoAI process

For additional detail on each of these phases, including links to associated research papers and descriptions of the algorithms applied to create the model pipelines, see AutoAI implementation details.
Data pre-processing

Most data sets contain different data formats and missing values, but standard machine learning algorithms work with numbers and no missing values. AutoAI applies various algorithms, or estimators, to analyze, clean, and prepare your raw data for machine learning. It automatically detects and categorizes features based on data type, such as categorical or numerical. Depending on the categorization, it uses hyper-parameter optimization to determine the best combination of strategies for missing value imputation, feature encoding, and feature scaling for your data.
Automated model selection

The next step is automated model selection that matches your data. AutoAI uses a novel approach that enables testing and ranking candidate algorithms against small subsets of the data, gradually increasing the size of the subset for the most promising algorithms to arrive at the best match. This approach saves time without sacrificing performance. It enables ranking a large number of candidate algorithms and selecting the best match for the data.

For information on how to handle automatically-generated pipelines to select the best model, refer to Selecting an AutoAI model. Automated feature engineering

Feature engineering attempts to transform the raw data into the combination of features that best represents the problem to achieve the most accurate prediction. AutoAI uses a unique approach that explores various feature construction choices in a structured, non-exhaustive manner, while progressively maximizing model accuracy using reinforcement learning. This results in an optimized sequence of transformations for the data that best match the algorithms of the model selection step.",What is Data Science ?,,1.0,124,Science & Technology

Machine Learning is a powerful technology that extracts information from historical data to give you insight, e.g. to classify customers, predict behaviours, forecast demands. The next actions that are best to execute is more difficult to define when different constraints and objectives are to be taken into account between the different decisions.

Decision Optimization is a powerful technology that uses the outcome of Machine Learning and prescribes the best set of next decisions taking into account laws, constraints, regulations and trade-offs between different business objectives.
The industry case

A retail bank sold several products (mortgage accounts, savings accounts, and pension accounts) to its customers. It kept a record of all historical data, and this data is available for analysis and reuse. Following a merger in 2019, the bank has new customers and wants to launch some marketing campaigns.

The budget for the campaigns is limited. The bank wants to contact a customer and propose only one product.

The marketing department needs to decide:

    Who should be contacted?
    Which product should be proposed?
    Proposing too many products is counter-productive, so only one product per customer contact is proposed.
    How a customer should be contacted?
    There are different ways, with different costs and efficiency.
    How can they optimally use their limited budget?
    Are such campaigns profitable?

Predictive and prescriptive workflow

This notebook takes you through the following steps:

From the historical data, you train a machine learning product-based classifier on a customer profile (age, income, account level, ...) to predict whether a customer would subscribe to a mortgage, savings, or pension account.

Then, you apply this predictive model to new customer data to predict for each new customer what they might purchase. Then, you apply a Decision Optimization model to find out which product should be offered to which customer through which channel. The solutions can be displayed and analyzed.

Table of contents:

1. Understand the historical data
2. Train a model to predict customer behavior
3. Predict the new customer behavior
4. Prescribe the best business decisions
5. Run some what-if analysis
6. Conclusion

Note: Make sure you run the code cell at the top of this notebook. All projects in IBM Watson Studio have an authorization token that is used to enable access to project assets, for example data assets and connections, and is used by platform APIs. This token is called the project access token. The code to use this token was added to the notebook for you during the project template import.

We will also look at how to add a Primary Key to an existing table, also looking at how to create a primary key on a temp table.

Content

00:00 Intro
00:25 Create table with Primary Key
01:50 Create Primary Key on table
03:54 Create primary key on temp table

What does a Primary Key Do?

A Primary Key ensures uniqueness in a table. What does that mean? It means that each row in the table can be uniquely identified, in this case by a number. For example, if you work at a company, you will have an employee Id. No one else has this same ID as you, if they did the business would have all sorts of problems with payment and booking holiday etc. 

Primary Keys are the backbone of good table design in SQL Server, when we design tables, we need to add a PK to ensure that we don’t accidently add an employee with the same ID. 

So this is vital stuff we are learning here! It’s pivotal to your SQL journey.

Naming Primary Key on SQL Table

As explained in the lesson, we should be naming our PKs, this gives us a clear description of what it is (prefixed with PK) the table name it is part of and the column it is assigned to!

Its good practice to do this, we can also run a query (if we wanted) on sys.objects and filter all the PKs, this would help us easily identify which PKs we have on which table and the columns they are part of. It saves us manually going into each table and searching – and we all love a bit of time saving!

Adding Primary Keys to Temp Tables

The only time I suggest we don’t name Primary Keys would be on temp tables. Why? Temp tables are usually part of a stored procedure which means multiple people could run the same stored procedure at the same time.

SQL doesn’t allow duplicate object names and types, so we wouldn’t be able to create two Primary Keys with the same name. The second person running this SP would get a failure.

We can create multiple temp tables with the same name as that’s handled differently – but I will go over that in another lesson.

Adding Primary Keys to Existing Tables

Sometimes we come across and existing table which we may want to repurpose or someone forgot to add a PK on. In this case we can add the PK after table creation.

This is something we should all know. Sometimes it can be a bit tricky if the data in there is duplicated but that is also for another time! In this tutorial we cover how to ALTER a TABLE and add a Primary Key – with and without a name.

We create them with the INCLUDE clause and see when they are and are not used, along with seeing how they can help with performance tuning.

03:35 Create Filtered Index
04:14 Filtered vs Non Filtered Index performance

06:44 Create Filtered Index with Include

What is a filtered index in SQL Server?

A filtered index is basically a trimmed down version of a standard Non-Clustered index. Some describe it as a lightweight index as it contains certain rows from a column. You can create Filtered Indexes using the following types of operators:

- Equals =
- Greater or Less Than 
- Using IN
- Creating more than one filter in your WHERE

Filtered Index Benefits

The benefits of a filtered index would mean that there are reduced storage costs, because the index is smaller in size. Write operations are potentially less frequent, reading from the index would be quicker than a non filtered index because of its reduction in rows. As a database administrator this is great as your maintenance routines such as index rebuilds would be quicker, an end user wouldn't care about this but its certainly beneficial for DBAs.

Filtered Index in SQL Server Example

Imagine you have an index on gender for a list of employees, you could create an index just on 'F' (if this suited the majority of your queries). This would mean that your index would only contain rows where the Gender = 'F', so it could reduce the size of your index by 50%.

Downsides to filtered indexes

There are downsides to creating filtered indexes, unless you understand which query or queries you are targeting then there is a chance they may not be used - I give a great example of how in this tutorial. 

Another potential downside is that you could end up doubling up on your indexes unintentionally. In the above example of creating an index on 'F', if you had an index on all genders and they were searched for equally then the filter index wouldn't be worth it. However, if you searched for 'F' 90% of the time then it would be very beneficial, so the lesson here is ""understand what your filtered index is for, before creating it! No guess work!""

Filtered index with INCLUDE

This tutorial shows you how to create an index with an INCLUDE. The reason for this is that some queries may ask for more columns than the index can return - it can't satisfy the query, so we need to include further columns to ensure our index is being used. I cover this well in the tutorial.

Limitations of Filtered Indexes

Due to the design of filtered indexes you are unable to create indexes with:
- Date Functions, such as DATEADD
- On Computed columns
- Using expressions such as NOT IN and CASE

Filtered Indexes Best Practice

Best practice for SQL Server indexes would be as follows:
-Have a good naming convention. In this tutorial I use IX_tablename_columnnames_F to show its filtered
- Understand the query which you are targeting, do not create them hoping for them to be used – they most likely won’t be
- If possible, target most unique column values. This best practice with all SQL Server indexes

In this tutorial we partition by date.

Advantages of Partitioning Tables in SQL Server

There are multiple benefits to partitioning. Some of these may include faster queries for example. By having a big table divided up into smaller chunks, you reduce the amount of data that needs to be scanned and accessed. 

Think of it as having to find all records for 2016. Now if you had all your data partitioned by year then SQL Server would know to just read the 2016 partition, reducing your reads greatly.

Partition Switching (Swapping)

Archiving or purging data can also be greatly improved, in this tutorial we look at partition switching (or partition swapping as some people refer to it as). Here we can switch a partition into a staging table, so in the above example we can switch all 2016 data into a replica table, archive this off elsewhere. Its a fantastic feature

Truncate Partitions

Using the TRUNCATE TABLE tablename WITH (PARTITIONS) command we are able to now truncate specific partitions without affecting the remaining data. This is awesome! Imagine your data cleansing routines at the end of the year just getting rid of data from 5 years ago in a second! Makes admin tasks a lot easier. 

SSIS Imports (ETL)

Consider any ETL or SSIS packages which need to import large amounts of data, we can import this into a staging table, switch the partition and its done in seconds. All the heavy work is done into another table with no effects to main table.

SQL Function Types

In this tutorial we look at a number of functions, but do not cover the complete spectrum of what is available.

- System Functions
- Aggregate Functions
- Table Valued Functions
- Scalar Functions
- Functions vs Stored Procedures

Where possible I have created a tutorial for each of these types of functions and have linked to them from the video to give you more of an overview.

What is a Function?

A SQL Server function is first and foremost a database object - as are stored procedures, tables, views etc. A function accepts input parameters, it will perform a task and then return you a result.

For example; you may have a function that calculates the percentage of a number ( as I have demoed in this video). You could call this function with two numbers and it would return the percentage difference of the two

What are the benefits of Functions?

Functions are really handy! Using the function scenario above I had lost count of the amount of times that I've needed to re-write the same bit of code over the years, it was far easier to use this code and contain it within a database function, that way its re-usable code. That is the biggest benefit, re-usable code that's easily maintained and called.

Limitations of Functions

SQL functions can't be called remotely - so by that they can't be called over a linked server and should only be called on the database server they designed to run on. This isn't covered within this tutorial but happy to go over that if people want to and can easily knock up a video demonstrating that.

With the lesson broken down into chapters it will make easy learning for you.

Some people may refer to creating Composite Keys as 'Creating Primary Keys on more than one column'. Basically - thats correct! A Composite Key is a Primary Key which consists of more than one column.

Here we look at how you should create Composite Keys. Firstly, we need to understand what sort of data would be going into the table and furthermore, how will it be searched? How will the application be accessing this data? If for example we will be searching for it by FullName, then having the Composite Key on Address wouldn't be very beneficial. We go over that in this SQL lesson.

During the tutorial we use the SQL Server Execution plan to see how our searches are being searched for by the SQL Server Engine. The execution plan tells us the cost of the query, the number of rows that have been read, whether it used an index and how - it's fantastic stuff!

I like to also stick to naming conventions with any Indexes and Primary Keys that are created and we follow that here. Any questions then let me know in the comments below

Benefits

Its a really handy method if you want to duplicate a table structure, its seen sometimes with staging tables or as an alternative to temp tables and table variables. Personally I've only seen it used within stored procedures. Its a quick method to create a table rather than creating all the data types.

A big benefit is sometime where you just want some of the data from table a placed into table b. Maybe you might be recovering data for example

Is it good practice

In reality, its better practice to just create a table properly if you want a static table, if you only needed it temporarily, then I'd suggest using temp tables or table variables

Along with the Create Table syntax, I also show the relevant INSERT statement we are using and save the file along with the Powershell script.

Powershell Script

The powershell script is simple Invoke-sqlcmd cmdlet. This passes in the database instance along with the server name and an input file. Later in the tutorial we look at how add logging within this also. 

Its really nice and simple - just 3 lines of code (it could even be done in 1!)

Logging errors

Within the tutorial I also look at how to catch any errors that may occur while we run the script, we may be automating this process and have it running on a schedule for example. To do this we can create a nice log file which captures any errors which we could potentially check should we not be getting the required results.

Firstly we look at what a timeout is in SQL Server and how to trigger one. Most of us would think that it's a query that has simply exceeded it's 'timeout setting' and stopped running, however SQL isn't aware of what that setting is, so just views Timeouts as aborted transactions. The great thing about this is that we can replicate this by cancelling the query. To show how we capture this in Extended Events I add a WAITFOR DELAY within a query and ensure implicit transactions are turned off and run a simple query against the database and kill it before the WAITFOR has been hit - easy!

The settings of how to setup this XE is shown, so you can set this up within your home SSMS if you wanted and have a play around before introducing it in a live environment. The great thing is that Extended Events is very lightweight so shouldn't have a detrimental effect on performance - bonus!

Finally we run through how to group and view this data, which is great as the same method can be applied to any XE.

We use Sub Queries, Select Statements, JOINS and what I call the 'popular method' (you see it all over forums)

Gathering The Data

In this part of the video I run through what data we are going to update and which tables we are using. We need to alter the foreign key constraint at first in order to do the lesson so I show you how to do that here. I also query the source and target table to show which table we are going to update

We use the AdventureWorks2019 database which is a free download from Microsoft (or you can watch my tutorial on setting it up). 

Select and Update in One Query

My personal favourite method for quick easy updates. This suits smaller updates and rather that use the IN Operator we reference the values that we need to update and is the perfect example of having select and update in one query. Its a nice beginner method if you are learning SQL Server

Update Using Merge

This is slightly tougher, only because a Merge Statement isn't as easy to write as a sub query, but when checking the execution plan it can be far more efficient in this case so for bigger update statements it's well worth considering especially if you intend on running this query on a regular basis, maybe via SQL Agent

Update With a JOIN

Often a popular question, I guess because we use JOINS so often when querying SQL Server that we want to know up to update the table we have just joined! Here I show you a way to turn your JOIN query into an update. A very basic thing which you will find helpful.

The Popular Method

This is always a suggestion on forums and blogs so I had to include it. Personally it isn't my favourite but it's personal preference. Let me know what you think

This is really simple, and always worth learning as I guarantee you that it will save you LOADS of time in your career whether that be restoring database or testing scripts and what's more, it's extremely useful if you are planning to be a Data Analyst.

Tutorial Overview

In this exercise we use the AdventureWorks2019 database (don't worry I link to a tutorial on how to download this), we create a sample table
and then Insert Into the new table from an existing table.

Insert Into From Select Query

The basic premise is that we need to first establish what our SELECT query should be, and we can sense check that data, if any of that data is incorrect (or not appearing how we want it) then we can amend the query to reflect the data. In this tutorial I show you how to change the date column using the GETDATE function and insert into the new table using INSERT INTO SELECT.

As you will see there are multiple ways of doing this, all have their pro's and cons but are all worth knowing. What's more is that this is a really simple tutorial to follow and good practice.

Test-Path if exists

The Powershell test-path cmdlet lets us do exactly what it says on the tin! It enables us to test a path or a file and check if it exists. The result of this is true or false.
This is such an easy cmdlet to use and so useful and its a great way to show the benefits of using it within SQL Agent. 

Here we run test-path to check the file exists, if so then it moves onto the next step of the job. Secondly we use test-path if not exists so if the file isn't there we throw an error.

Powershell Scripts in SQL Agent

We then move the script into SQL Agent and use it as a priliminary check. If the cmdlet results return true to step is marked as a success and then moved onto step 2 of the agent job. If its false we use THROW and this will fail the SQL Agent job.
I've recently used this where I had to check to see whether a backup file exists, if it does then the next step restores the backup. It meant that I was able to run the job without having failures for intermittent missing files (it wasn't a Live environment so it was essential a file existed).

How To Run Powershell in SQL Agent.

Although I show you the script being run within SQL I don't cover how to set the job up (which I can cover in a seperate tutorial), however to do this setup a SQL Agent job in the usual way but set the type as 'Powershell'. This then allows us to use powershell scripts instead of SQL Code.
The other potential issue is if your SQL Server databases aren't setup against the C: drive then you may find errors when executing scripts, in which case you will need to change the directory at the start of the script using CD C:

How To Create Foreign Key Constraints

We look at how to create Foreign keys along with why they are needed and what we need to check prior to creating them. Foreign keys can be created when we create the table, or alternatively they can be created afterward. In this tutorial I show you both. I find its very useful to know how to create Foreign Keys using code personally and as a DBA or a Data Analyst you should understand this.

Foreign Key Error

Very frequently we may find that we are getting Foreign Key errors in SQL Server, errors such as 'Violation of Foreign Key Constraint'. This is usually raised when inserting into a table and the the value the Foreign Key is referencing, isn't there - so the constraint is doing its job. Remember a Foreign Key is there to enforce integrity in a database. In this tutorial we recreate that error and explain why it happens and more importantly - how to fix it!

Primary Key vs Foreign Key

Although this tutorial isn't solely on Primary Key vs Foreign Key (I will probably do one shortly), I do reference the usage of Primary Keys in this video and explain the comparison between the two. Knowing what a Primary Key is this tutorial shows you everything about a Foreign Key so the difference is explained to you here too.

How To Find Foreign keys in SQL Server Management Studio

There are times when we may want to know how to find foreign keys within SQL Server management studio. In this video we cover how to locate these within tables and I run through scripting them out and re-adding them. The biggest problem that I found when creating Foreign keys are that the data may need to be 'cleansed' first because you may be trying to create a Foreign Key on a table but the existing data within it contradicts what you are trying to do - so you need to prep the table first.

To explain the above example we look at how to remove a foreign key and then re-add it. 

As always, if there are any questions then let me know.

You can follow the same instructions in this tutorial for SQL Server 2014 or 2016 as the basics are exactly the same.

We also cover how to Download and Install SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). This is needed so we can access, query and maintain SQL Server. Again this is a free download from Microsoft and this tutorial covers how to download the latest version.

Once SQL Server is downloaded, installed and configured we will need a database to download and restore.

Primary Keys

Primary Keys are required in SQL Server to keep our data unique and to enforce integrity. We want don't want duplicate data and we would like to be able to differentiate two employees 
with the same name for example, so we assign each an Id. This makes each row in a SQL Server unique. Understanding how to create a primary key in SQL is  vital to good database table design

Auto Incrementing Id Columns 

The IDENTITY Keyword is explained in this tutorial. It runs through what it does and why it is needed. When creating Id's we usually want to auto increment our column by 1, however there are times 
where we may want to increment the values by 10 or a 100 for example. IDENTITY insert gives us the ability to define that when we create a table.

NULL vs NOT NULL

Do we want a value for every row on insert? We will do for some columns! Here we use the example of a persons name - we would always want their first name, but not always their middle name so NULL and NOT NULL
come into play here. NULL essentially means blank! Do we want this column to be blank or not blank?

Data Types

Creating tables in SQL Server is a relatively easy thing to do, however it is VERY easy to do this incorrectly. A number of things need to be covered, especially data types - 
because we need to understand beforehand what data is going into our tables, then we can determine what data types best suit the column. 

For example; string data such as Name, Addresses would be suited to having a VARCHAR data type. As this accepts string data. However if we are inserting timestamps VARCHAR wouldn't be 
ideal and would look to using a datatype such as DATETIME or simply DATE. SQL will then handle these columns as date and time fields and it makes us easier to query and report on.

The most common types of data types we will see in SQL tables are:

VARCHAR
DATETIME
INT
BIT
FLOAT

Understanding data types is briefly covered in this tutorial but to cover it extensively would be within another video

Errors when Inserting into Tables

This lesson covers a number of errors that we often encounter when inserting both single and multiple rows into SQL Tables. The most common errors are:

Column name or number of supplied values does not match table definition.
There are fewer columns in the insert statement than values specified in the VALUES clause. The number of values in the VALUES column must match number of columns
Cannot insert the value NULL into column, table; column does not allow nulls. insert fails.
The definition for column 'Id' must include a data type

This tutorial shows these error and how to avoid them why they are caused

I've also covered a few other points such as a query on how to find duplicates and how not to delete them!

HOW TO DELETE DUPLICATES USING A CTE

Personally I think the best, easiest and quickest way to delete duplicate rows is to use a CTE with the ROW NUMBER function. Its easier to analyse the data beforehand to ensure your query is correct but also ensures that anything with more than one record is removed! Obviously like anything in SQL Server there are a load of ways of doing the same thing, some quicker than others but I like simplicity and cte's give us that!

HOW NOT TO DELETE DUPLCATE RECORDS IN SQL

Whats just as important is to understand how NOT TO delete duplicate records as this can lead to data loss. So I've covered two ways of doing this and explained what dangers and pitfalls to look out for by comparing a SQL CTE with a GROUP BY and HAVING clause. This will show you how one method removes a duplicate while the other will remove both rows from the table

HOW TO PREVENT DUPLICATE RECORDS

The lesson also shows how to use PRIMARY KEYS to prevent duplicates being inserted in the first place. This can save us all a great deals of headaches just by setting up some good database design practices so we as DBAs we don't encounter the problem in the first place!

I think you will find the lesson helpful, but take a look at my other tutorials and as always give me a shout or comment if  you have any questions.

Within a Live Production Environment we are constantly battling against poor running queries which will impact overall SQL Server performance. Historically we have used SQL Profiler, run a trace and identified any problematic stored procedures that are returned when we happen to be running our trace. With Extended Events we can create a Session that will just capture specific data if it fits within our chosen criteria.

In this video, I've used queries that run over 10 seconds. Ordinarily we would probably set that threshold to 30 seconds or a minute (the video would take far too long to do that and become quite boring so I've done you favour and reduced the threshold!!). Once we've identified these routines, we tune them and get them down to a more manageable level. Once we got rid of most of the items in the Extended Event session we can change the threshold to 30 seconds and tackle the next batch of queries. Over time we are going to see huge improvements on wait time, CPU and overall performance.

As with all performance tuning, there is very rarely one thing that resolves all our problems but we need to tackle one thing at a time - this event will give us a huge head start.

For example; if you tell SQL that you want all employees from a database table where the age is equal to 15 – then equals is your operator! Alternatively, you may want to return employees where their age is greater than 40 – greater than is your operator here! 

The SQL operators covered in this Lesson are:

What you will learn in this course?

The course is designed to give a comprehensive overview of the Firebase Framework and will teach you how to integrate multiple firebase features together to create robust applications.You will learn how to  ""put it all together"" as opposed to learning isolated topics alone. Many topics in the course are revisited in subsequent sections of the course to reinforce ideas previously discussed.  You will find new use cases and create applications with multiple firebase features as you progress through the course.

Who is the course aimed at? This is not a beginner's course.  It's assumed you have some Swift and iOS development experience or have been through some training so that you understand the basics of iOS development.

If you are an iOS development looking to become skilled in Firebase and/or to take your iOS application skills up a notch then this is the course for you.

Pre-requisites.

iOS development generally requires a Mac computer - you need to have a working Mac OS installation with Xcode 10.1 or later.  Some sections of the course require a physical iOS device (for example push notifications).

I'm talking in this video about the Central Processing Unit, or CPU as well as storage and memory.

As a programmer, or someone striving to become one, I feel it's important to understand what goes on under the hood - at least at a high level.  

Hopefully, after watching this video you will come away with better knowledge (and appreciation) of how the CPU works, and just how incredible an invention it really is.

Join my 1-ON-1 Coaching Program (GET THE JOB): https://bit.ly/3HObnVA

The job interview process.

Any time to go through the job interview process asked yourself... 

How can I completely differentiate myself and stand out from everyone else?

Always have in mind that there are 2 important things that you have to accomplished when you go through the job interview process.

1. They have to LIKE YOU.

2. They have to think of you that YOU CAN GET THE JOB DONE.

Know that you have 100% control for you to accomplished both when you go through the job interview process.

Another things that you have to have in mind when you go through the job interview process is to think of it as just a CONVERSATION that you are having with people you know, like, and trust. 

If the the one person, or few people that interview you felt that they just interviewed another candidate, and not felt like they had a conversation with a friend, they you may not get the job.

Here is the FRAMEWORK that will help you for people to LIKE YOU, THINK OF YOU THAT YOU CAN GET THE JOB DONE, and make them feel just like if they are having a CONVERSATION with someone they know (a friend).

(WATCH VIDEO and take notes for better understating)

STEP 1.

Connect - Whenever someone asks you something you should know that you need to connect with them as soon as you open your mouth.

Connecting means making them relate to you. Because they might be not mentally present there. Once you connect, they start liking you and trusting you. 

STEP 2.

Educate - You can't educate someone by answering the question focus on only providing information based on the question they asked you.

The way you educate someone is by not ONLY answering the question they asked you by providing details, but by talking about 3 to 4 topics that are related to the question they asked you but not something that they asked you directly, it has to be related to the topic in question. (see video for more info and better understanding.)

STEP 3.

Present - This is how to put a picture in someone else mind, and be able to create a scenario for the to see/imagine so that you can show what skills, experience, value you have, and what you are really capable of doing based on what they are looking for.

Remember the picture/scenario you are creating should be very SIMPLE to process in the brain. A little hard they won't listen to you because the mind DON'T like to take time to figure things out.

STEP 4.

Story-Tell - The only way to show them that you can get the job done is by Story-tell. You might answer all the questions and you might also educate them on different topics which are good but at the end of the interview they will always think ""Can you get the job done?"".

and the only way to show them that you can get the job done is by Story-Tell.

Let's talk about how to start a career in Cyber Security and the TOP and number one certification that you need to get in order for you to be on your way to become a Cyber Security Engineer.

I know there are  many IT Certifications out there and many people may advise you to get your CompTIA Certifications, or may be other vendor IT Certifications such as the CEH, Security+, etc.

But you need to start with the Cisco CCNA Certification, and that's because you need to start your IT Career with a job that can give you the opportunity for you to learn and have the hands on experience in networking, for you to know about a Network Infrastructure and then you can go on and become a Cyber Security Engineer.

Again, watch the videos and lets have a conversation about it.

Will entry level certifications be worth it in 2022? In this video, I´ll give you my insight into whether entry level certifications will be important in 2022 or not. I will be considering many factors that affect this, but in this video I´ll give you the big picture of it and the truth about entry level certifications.

Entry level certifications are known to be ""the right way"" to start your IT Career, but have you ever wondered if they´re really necessary?. Im sure at least one person has told you that you should get x certification or y certification to start your career, without even knowing there are other ways to start it.

The majority of people take them, having in mind that the more certifications they have, the better chances they´ll get, when in reality this hasn't been the case, especially in today's market. This video will give you a better view of what really are entry level certifications, and if you really need them to begin your journey to a badass maven engineer.

Take your IT Career to the next level with NEA´s membership: https://bit.ly/3oA9i60

What would your answer be if someone asked you ""What is DHCP?"" in the job interview? Think about it for a second, and let me know in the comments. Answering technical questions makes a huge difference in the job interview process. Most of the people is going to give an average answer, which is fine, but we are aiming at differentiating ourselves from the other candidates. 

Recruiters hear the same answers over and over again, and while you can show that you know about the topic, you´re not making their job easier by answering like everyone else. This issue is one of the most common mistakes people make when they go through the job interview process. 

In this video, I´ll show you how you can differentiate yourself from other candidates by answering this very common question. Remember, you need to stand out from the rest, and that you´re competing with many other people that want the same position as you do.

In this video, I will teach you the best process to review and study the Cisco CCNA exam questions, and not only that, but this will also help you in ANY OTHER IT Certification.

The most common process people follow to study is going on labs, getting the book, etc for 2-4 months, and when they take the test they fail and repeat the same process hoping this time they got it right! 

This is VERY common and let me tell you why they fail... it´s because they don´t know how to study, they don´t have the right mindset and approach to get the answers right.  And no... you DO NOT need to memorize any questions.

Following the right process, going by the right mindset and approach, that I will share with you in this video, will get you far when it comes to answering the most difficult and technical questions that may come your way in any certification exam and even in job interviews.

So, I recommend you take notes throughout the video and study it, so you´ll know better the next time you get a certification!

How to start your IT career in 2021? That's the question that many people are currently asking, as there are so many opportunities and job opening in IT.

There are so many options and ways for you to start a career in IT, many possible ways, but UNFORTUNATLY no one will give you advise or guidance for you to do it the RIGHT WAY.

Anybody can start a career in IT, but NOT everyone can do it in a way that can differentiate themselves in order to get the job.

Really, think about it. 🤔

How can you completely differentiate yourself from the other dozen candidates that are trying to get the same job that you want? HOW?

If you are going to do exactly what everyone else is doing... you won't be able to differentiate yourself and will be VERY DIFFICULT TO get the job you want.

Let me explain what is virtualization and how it works, and the way I'm going to do it is in detail and through storytelling.

In this video I'm going to start giving you an introduction of virtualization and how it works, this way you get the big picture of why we need and how virtualization works.

Virtualization uses software to create an abstraction layer over computer hardware that allows the hardware elements of a single computer—processors, memory, storage and more—to be divided into multiple virtual computers, commonly called virtual machines (VMs).

What's a server and how it works, here I give you a detail explanation about what's a server and I will do it through storytelling, as this is the best way to teach technical information, learn by storytelling.

I know that you may know what's a server, but the way that I will present the information will help you a lot better in order for you to communicate and present it to someone else, this will help you a lot when you go through the job interview process.

👉 Server Definition
A server is a computer equipped with specific programs and/or hardware that enables it to offer services to other computers (clients) on its network. There are different types and capabilities of servers. Think about transportation. We can think of transportation as anything that can move something or someone from one location to the other. 

We have different types of servers such as:


👉 File Server
A file server is a server that contains files which are made accessible to other clients on the network. A file server has the sole responsibility for storing and managing a set of files, which are made accessible to other computers. These files are shared among clients in the network by allowing access without having to physically transfer the accessed files to their local systems.

👉 Print Server
A print server is a server which has a dedicated printer connected to it which is accessible by other clients through it on the same network. Other clients on the network can print work to this printer through this print server.

👉 Web Server
A web server is a server equipped with HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) that serves web pages in response to requests submitted by clients. 

👉 Application Server
An application server stores and manages all applications between an organization's users and its databases or backend business applications. If you've visited a bank to withdraw money, then you've accessed the bank's application server through the services of the attending teller.

Whaat can be more powerful than taking Cisco, CompTIA, or Microsoft Certifications? This is something that NO ONE teach in the IT community, and no one mention this as well.

Look, IT Certifications from Cisco, Microsoft, CompTIA, and other vendors  help A LOT, but you need more than that to be able to get the job that you want and fast, and a job that will pay you very well.

You need to start doing things different and start to position yourself in the market better than other people.

Cisco CCNA 200-301 will GET YOU an interview, BUT this [HIGH-PAID] SKILL will 😱 GET YOU THE JOB.

The Cisco CCNA Certification 200-301 or any other great IT Certification will get you an interview, but this high-paid skill will get you the job. 

Many people think that getting the cisco ccna 200-301 or any other IT Certifications will get them the job they want, but that's NOT reality.

This is why you need to take the time to differentiate yourself from everyone else, and you do it by learning high paid skills.

HIGH-PAID SKILL FOUR.

In this video we went through STORYTELLING.

Now you know that MARKETING = STORYTELLING AND STORYTELLING = MARKETING.

If you understand the power of story you’ll be unstoppable le and if you don’t understand it, you’ll be like everyone else.

Storytelling can be use and apply when you answer technical questions, when you have ANYTHING TO SAY OR COMMUNICATE! – IS THAT SIMPLE.

A lot of people have a very weak way to communicate what they know, the experience they have, etc  

Either is noise that confuse people that comes out of your mouth, or sounds bites that creates images in their mind.

Also, remember when you want to get attention from other people, you can do that when you tell stories.

When you want people to listen to you, you tell stories, when you want to teach and connect with other people, you tell stories.

Start working on storytelling and you better create a compelling story that can tell me who you are becoming without bragging about yourself.
